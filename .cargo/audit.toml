    # rsa timing sidechannel (Marvin Attack) — transitive via sqlx-mysql.
    # We only use sqlx with PostgreSQL; sqlx-mysql is an unused compile-time
    # feature dependency. No fix available upstream.

    # wasmtime fd_renumber host panic — our WASI shim returns ENOSYS for all
    # fd operations; fd_renumber is never reachable. Upgrade to wasmtime 34+
    # planned but requires API migration.
