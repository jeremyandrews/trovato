# Netgrasp plugin — design gate

The scope for this build (TROVATO-CLOSE A7 / NETGRASP 03) carries three
assumptions about the frozen kernel that turn out not to hold. Each of them was
load-bearing for a data-model choice, so this document records what the kernel
actually does, checked at `KERNEL_API_VERSION (0,99)`, and what follows.

The pattern being followed is the one CLOSE 09/A1/A5 landed for Argus: an
in-repo pure WASM plugin (`plugins/netgrasp`) over a host-agnostic core crate
(`crates/netgrasp-core`), with high-churn data as lightweight records and only
the user-editable surface as Items. Nothing in the kernel, WIT, SDK or kernel
migrations was changed.

## Drift from the scope's kernel model

### Drift 1 — there is no per-content-type opt-out of embedding

The scope says: *"kernel auto-embed is now async with per-content-type opt-out —
the old 'events-as-Items costs an embed per event' caveat is DISSOLVED: opt
`ng_event` out of embedding in this plugin's declaration."*

`EmbedPolicy` (`crates/kernel/src/services/embed_index.rs:64-95`) has exactly one
field, `sync_types: Vec<String>`, and `is_async()` returns whether a type is
**absent** from it. A type listed there does not skip embedding — it opts out of
the *async* path and takes the pre-P11f **synchronous** embed on the save path
instead (`crates/kernel/src/content/item_service.rs:653-655`). Both branches call
the provider. There is no third value that means "do not embed this type".

It is also not declarable by a plugin. The policy is read from `site_config`
under `embed_policy` (`EMBED_POLICY_CONFIG_KEY`, `embed_index.rs:62`,
`EmbedPolicy::load` at `:83`); `PluginInfo` has no embedding section
(`crates/kernel/src/plugin/info_parser.rs`). A plugin cannot opt anything out of
anything, in this plugin's declaration or elsewhere.

### Drift 2 — a plugin's `save-item` never embeds anyway, because it bypasses `ItemService`

The `save-item` host function calls the **model** directly — `Item::update` /
`Item::create` (`crates/kernel/src/host/item.rs:131,159`) — not
`ItemService::create`/`update`. Everything `ItemService` does around a save is
therefore skipped on the plugin path, including `index_item`
(`item_service.rs:603`), which is what enqueues the embed job.

So the embed cost of plugin-written Items is zero today, but for the opposite of
the reason the scope gives: not because the type opted out, but because the
plugin write path never reaches the embedder at all. This is the mechanism behind
M2's `G-ITEM-NO-EMBED` ("stories have no embeddings, semantic gather needs a
manual admin backfill"), now identified rather than merely observed.

This is not a licence to make events Items — see Decision 2. It removes one cost,
and leaves the one that actually decides it.

### Drift 3 — `tap_item_update` does not fire on a plugin's own `save-item`

Same cause, and it is the most consequential of the three. `tap_item_update` is
dispatched from exactly one place, `ItemService::update`
(`item_service.rs:553`, plus the revision-revert path at `:1398`). Its callers are
the admin content routes and the JSON item routes
(`state.items().update(...)` — `routes/admin_content.rs:513,664`,
`routes/item.rs:882`). `save-item` does not go through it.

The scope asks us to "guarantee the sync loop terminates". Under the frozen
contract it terminates **by construction**: the plugin's daemon→kernel sync
writes Items through `save-item`, which cannot fire the tap that would trigger
the kernel→daemon write-back. The two directions are disjoint at the contract
level, not by a convention this plugin maintains.

That is a strong guarantee and a fragile one — it holds because of an omission,
not a decision, and the day `save-item` is routed through `ItemService` (which is
the obvious correctness fix for Drift 2) the loop closes. So the plugin **also**
carries the belt-and-braces discipline that would make it terminate anyway
(Decision 4), and a test pins the kernel behaviour so the day it changes, a test
says so.

## Decisions

### Decision 1 — a device is a **split**: a daemon-owned record and a user-owned Item

Neither single-tier shape is available.

*All-Item* fails on churn. A device's `state`, `last_ip`, `current_location` and
`last_seen` change every time the daemon sees it — an online/offline flip per
device per few minutes on a live LAN. Every push would be an `Item::update`,
which writes an `item_revision` row (`crates/kernel/src/content/item.rs`), so a
40-device LAN would accumulate revisions at the rate of ARP traffic. Item storage
is the wrong tier for something that changes on a timer.

*All-record* fails on writability. The record admin is list-and-view only
(`crates/kernel/src/routes/admin_record_type.rs:181-183`) and no kernel surface
lets a plugin serve a request (M3 `G-NO-PLUGIN-HTTP`), so a lightweight record has
no edit path at all. Naming a device is the feature; a shape where nobody can
name a device is not a shape.

So:

| Tier | What it holds | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `ng_devices` table, declared as record type `ng_device_state` | daemon-owned identity + volatile state | the daemon; the plugin writes only the user columns and the link |
| `ng_device` Item | the user's overlay: label, owner, notes, hidden, notify | an admin, through the kernel's content forms; created once by sync |

The two column sets are **fixed and disjoint**, which is what makes "the two
writers never collide" a schema property rather than a promise:

- **daemon-owned:** `mac`, `resolved_name`, `identity_source`,
  `identity_confidence`, `hostname`, `mdns_name`, `vendor`, `device_type`,
  `device_type_confidence`, `os_family`, `state`, `last_ip`, `last_ipv6`,
  `last_interface`, `first_seen_at`, `last_seen_at`, `baseline`, `current_ap`,
  `current_location`, `sync_state`, and the generated `first_seen_at_epoch` /
  `last_seen_at_epoch` twins
- **user-owned:** `display_name`, `owner_item_id`, `notes`, `hidden`, `notify`
- **link-owned (plugin):** `trovato_item_id`

The daemon's schema is **canonical** for every `ng_` table: it is the only writer
at runtime and its migrations are already applied, so where the two disagreed,
this side moved. Two things moved on the daemon's side instead, both because the
kernel leaves no alternative: the Item join columns are `UUID` because the
kernel's `item.id` is, and every `timestamptz` carries a generated
`<column>_epoch` companion because the `db` host cannot decode a `timestamptz` at
all and returns it as `null` (`FRICTION.md`, `G-DB-HOST-TYPE-COVERAGE`). Every
time the plugin reads is read from a twin.

`netgrasp_core::columns::USER_OWNED` names the second set once, the
write-back builds its `UPDATE` from that list and nothing else, and a test asserts
the three sets are disjoint and that the write-back statement mentions no column
outside its own set.

### Decision 2 — events are a **lightweight record**, not an Item

Drift 2 removes the embedding argument in both directions, so the decision rests
on what is left:

- **Revisions.** 300 events/day × 90 days ≈ 27,000 Items, each with at least one
  `item_revision` row, for rows that are never edited and are deleted wholesale
  on a retention timer. `item` is a revisioned, access-controlled, translatable,
  taxonomy-capable store; an event uses none of it.
- **Pruning.** As records, the retention pass is one bounded
  `DELETE FROM ng_events WHERE timestamp_epoch < $1` per cron tick. As Items it is one
  `delete-item` host call per row, each dispatching `tap_item_delete` to every
  plugin, 300 times a day, inside a 150 s background epoch.
- **Query shape.** The event log filters on `event_type`, `device_id` and
  `timestamp`. As record columns those are real Postgres types with real indexes;
  as Item fields they are JSONB text extractions.
- **What is given up.** Comments, revisions, semantic search and per-item access
  control on an event — none of which an event log wants.

M1's finding that "the record tier is solid and is the right home for
high-volume articles" applies unchanged to events, which are higher-volume and
less interesting than articles.

`ng_presence`, `ng_ip_history` and `ng_location_history` are the same argument at
higher volume still, and are additionally not standalone entities — they are the
device's timeline. They stay daemon tables, declared as read-only record types so
an operator can inspect them, and are rendered onto the device page by
`tap_item_view` (Decision 5).

### Decision 3 — a person is an Item, mirrored to `ng_people` for the daemon

People are created and edited by a human and there are tens of them, so the
churn argument that ruled devices out of the Item tier does not apply. `ng_person`
is a plain Item.

The daemon needs to read people and ownership without touching kernel tables (it
is a separate process with its own connection and no business knowing the `item`
schema), so `tap_item_insert` / `tap_item_update` / `tap_item_delete` on
`ng_person` mirror the Item into a flat `ng_people` table keyed by the Item id.
The mirror is derived state, one direction only, and the daemon treats it as
read-only.

Ownership is `ng_devices.owner_item_id` → `ng_people.item_id`, so the daemon
answers "whose device is this" with one join and never reads `item`.

### Decision 4 — the write-back is create-once, and terminates for two independent reasons

**Daemon → kernel** (`tap_cron`): rows with `sync_state = 'dirty'` are read in
bounded pages. For each:

- no `trovato_item_id`, or one naming an Item that no longer exists → create the
  device Item (`save-item` with no id), write the id back, set `sync_state = 'clean'`;
- an existing Item → refresh the derived title only, then set `sync_state = 'clean'`.

The Item's title is `COALESCE(display_name, hostname, vendor || ' device', mac)`
(`netgrasp_core::sync::derive_title`), which is the only thing the daemon side has
to say about an Item whose fields are otherwise all user-owned. This is why the
update branch has real work and is not scaffolding.

**Kernel → daemon** (`tap_item_update` on `ng_device`): writes exactly
`USER_OWNED` into `ng_devices WHERE trovato_item_id = $id`, and
`display_name` takes the Item's title. It does **not** write `sync_state`.

One subtlety, found by the integration test rather than by design, and worth
recording because the naive version is silently wrong: **an unchanged title must
clear `display_name`, not store it.** `display_name` outranks `hostname` in
`derive_title`, so if every save stored the title, an admin who edited only the
*notes* of a device still called `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff` would pin that MAC as its
label forever — the daemon could resolve a hostname the next minute and the
device would never take it. So the write-back compares the title against
`netgrasp_core::sync::daemon_title` (what the daemon's observations alone imply)
and stores `NULL` when they match. A name a human actually typed is stored and
wins; a name a human merely failed to change is not. The comparison uses the same
Rust function the sync uses rather than a `CASE` expression in the write-back's
SQL, so the two derivations cannot drift.

Termination, twice over:

1. *By contract* (Drift 3): the cron sync's `save-item` cannot dispatch
   `tap_item_update`, so the loop has no edge to traverse.
2. *By discipline*, which is what survives if (1) is ever fixed: the write-back
   never sets `sync_state = 'dirty'`, so even a firing tap produces a `clean` row
   that the next sync pass does not select. And the title the sync would then
   derive is `COALESCE(display_name, …)` where `display_name` is what the
   write-back just wrote from the title — a fixed point after one pass.

`netgrasp_core::sync::plan` is the pure function that decides create/relink/refresh
/skip, and it is where both properties are tested without a database.

### Decision 5 — the device page is `tap_item_view`, with single-quoted attributes

The presence and location timelines are the plugin's real UI work and there is
one surface for them. `tap_menu`'s `callback` is dropped on deserialize
(M3 `G-NO-PLUGIN-HTTP`), a plugin cannot ship a Tera template, and
`tap_preprocess_item` feeds a template the plugin does not own. `tap_item_view`'s
return value is appended to the item page's children, so that is where the
fragment goes.

It inherits M3's `G-VIEW-OUTPUT-JSON-ENCODED` verbatim: the `#[plugin_tap]` macro
JSON-serializes the return value and the item route appends it undecoded, so the
fragment uses **single-quoted attributes** and an escaper that emits
`&quot;`/`&#x27;`/`&#x5C;` and never a raw `"` or `\`. Same mitigation, same
reason, and a unit test asserts the fragment is free of both characters.

### Decision 6 — no exposed filters; facets are routes

`G-EXPOSED-FILTER-NO-MATCH-ALL` is worse for Netgrasp than it was for Argus,
because more of Netgrasp's facets are uuid columns on a **record** gather: an
exposed `equals` filter left blank binds `''` against a `uuid` column and the
gather **500s**, which is the default state of the page. So every facet is its
own route with a `{"url_arg": …}` filter whose value is always supplied:

| Route | Gather | Facet |
|---|---|---|
| `/devices` | `ng_device_list` | none |
| `/devices/online` | `ng_device_online` | none (`state = 'online'` fixed) |
| `/devices/type?device_type=…` | `ng_device_by_type` | device type |
| `/devices/owner?owner=…` | `ng_device_by_owner` | owner |
| `/events` | `ng_event_log` | none |
| `/events/security` | `ng_event_security` | none (fixed set) |
| `/events/device?device=…` | `ng_event_by_device` | device |
| `/people` | `ng_person_list` | none |

### Decision 7 — the tiles are gather tiles, because a tile cannot count

`G-NO-GATHER-AGGREGATION` is unchanged: `QueryDefinition` has no aggregate
projection and no tile type computes anything. "Online count" is therefore a
`gather_query` tile over `ng_device_online` whose **pager count** is the figure
and whose rows are what is behind it. Same for who-is-home, recent events and
security alerts. The shape is imposed, not chosen.

### Decision 8 — the plugin's migration is a **copy** of the daemon's schema

The daemon owns these tables at runtime, but the plugin's effective DB allowlist
is `migration-owned ∪ db_tables` (`crates/kernel/src/plugin/db_policy.rs`), and a
record type is only admitted over a table inside it
(`RecordTypeRegistry::admit`, `crates/kernel/src/content/record_type.rs:181`). More
practically: an install with no daemon yet must still be able to enable the
plugin, run its gathers and show empty pages rather than error.

So `001_netgrasp_schema.sql` creates every `ng_` table with
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, and what it creates is a **faithful copy of the
daemon's DDL** — same columns, same types, same order — with the guards added and
nothing else changed. `db_tables` names them all explicitly as well, so the
allowlist does not depend on `extract_created_tables` parsing.

It is a copy, not a convergence. An earlier version of this decision claimed the
migration "converges to the same schema whether the daemon or the plugin got
there first", achieved with a block of `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`.
That was wrong twice over: the two schemas disagreed on the primary key type, on
every timestamp and on four column names, none of which an `ADD COLUMN` can
reconcile — and `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` over an existing table is a silent
no-op whatever its shape, so nothing would have reported the difference. **On a
shared install the daemon migrates first**, and the plugin's copy exists only for
an install that has no daemon yet.

Since nothing in the kernel can check that claim, the plugin checks it itself:
`crates/netgrasp-core/tests/daemon_schema_test.rs::the_plugin_migration_is_a_faithful_copy_of_the_daemons_schema`
applies the daemon's DDL and the plugin's migration to two scratch schemas and
compares `information_schema.columns` table by table. Every other test in that
file runs the plugin's real statements — the constants in
`netgrasp_core::queries` — against the daemon's DDL rather than against the
plugin's copy of it.

The `ng_` prefix is not renamed.

## What is not in this build

- **No kernel modification.** Every friction item is reported, not fixed
  (`FRICTION.md`).
- **No daemon-side commit.** The `Code/netgrasp/` checkout named in the scope does
  not exist on this machine; `~/devel/rust/netgrasp-rs` is an empty tree with a
  `.git` directory and no working files, and no other copy is present. The
  daemon-side task ("verify the daemon tolerates user-owned columns being written
  by another process") could not be run. The plugin side of that contract is
  specified in `netgrasp_core::columns::USER_OWNED` and enforced by test, so
  the daemon-side check is a bounded follow-up rather than an open question.
- **No enrichment / UniFi, no arrival-departure notification** (CLOSE 16), **no iOS.**
