# Story 28.5: Update Alignment Documentation

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a **maintainer**,
I want the gap analysis and roadmap documentation to reflect current state,
So that contributors can trust the docs as an accurate picture of what's done and what remains.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `docs/alignment/gap-analysis.md` updated: gaps #1, #2, #3, #5, #6 marked as resolved with implementation references
2. `docs/alignment/roadmap.md` updated: success criteria table reflects actual subsystem status
3. Roadmap "near-term" section updated to remove already-implemented items
4. Any new gaps discovered during Epic 28 documented

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Update gap-analysis.md with resolution status for each gap (AC: #1)
- [ ] Update roadmap.md success criteria table (AC: #2)
- [ ] Update roadmap.md near-term recommendations (AC: #3)
- [ ] Review and update intentional-divergences.md if needed

## Dev Notes

### Key Files
